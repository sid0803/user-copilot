Business Signal Definitions for Heartbeat System.

This module defines the core data model for the Intelligence Layer.
An `Event` is a structured business signal — not a raw data point,
but a meaningful interpretation that directly tells the founder WHAT TO DO.

class BusinessEvent:
    """
    A structured business signal produced by the Intelligence Layer.

    Every BusinessEvent answers three founder questions:
      1. WHAT is happening?       → message
      2. HOW URGENT is it?        → severity
      3. WHAT should I do?        → action

    Unlike raw connector data or processor events, a BusinessEvent is
    already interpreted in business language — no technical jargon.
