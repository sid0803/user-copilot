"""
Founder Brain — Rule Engine for Heartbeat System.

This is the MOST IMPORTANT module in the system.

It converts raw, enriched processor events into structured BusinessEvents
that answer the founder's real question: "What should I DO right now?"

Each rule is a small, independently testable function.
Rules are registered in `RuleEngine.rules` and run against every batch of events.

Design principles:
  • Simple rules > complex ML (explainable, debuggable, fast)
  • Every rule produces zero or more BusinessEvents
  • Rules compose — they see the full event list, not just one at a time
  • Confidence scoring allows filtering noise
